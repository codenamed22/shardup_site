## Local Development

### Auth and Database Setup

The app uses Auth.js with Google OAuth, Prisma, and Postgres for the authentication and registration foundation.

Required environment variables are listed in `.env.example`.

For local development, Google credentials are optional. When `NODE_ENV` is not `production`, `/join` shows a development-only local sign-in button that creates an active admin test user in your local database. This lets contributors run the app without sharing Google OAuth secrets.

Google OAuth callback URLs:

- Local: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
- Production: `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/auth/callback/google`

Useful commands:

- `npm run prisma:generate`
- `npm run prisma:migrate`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`

Registration is application-first. Google sign-in creates the user identity, but member access remains gated until the application is approved by an admin.
