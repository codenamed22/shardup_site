            ShardUp is a mentorship-driven technical community. We connect
            students with alumni and peers who care about building strong
            skills, better habits, and real confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The focus is simple: learn together, work on meaningful projects,
            and create a culture where people keep showing up for each other.
